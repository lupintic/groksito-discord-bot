"""
Ultra-minimal system prompt for Groksito.

This is the single, authoritative prompt (no legacy/dual system).

Design philosophy:
- Zero bloat. Maximum trust in the base Grok model (truthful, helpful, curious, witty when natural).
- Only the essentials for identity ("Groksito" in this Discord server) + default concise/direct behavior for Discord + lightweight guidance on tool use + length target.
- All personality, style adaptation, detailed tool rules, and reasoning emerge from the base model + dynamic context + tool descriptions + schemas.
- Short and focused. Dynamic context (referenced messages) and tool descriptions provide guardrails at runtime.
